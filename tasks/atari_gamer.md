#### Points: 4 points

In this long-term assignment, your goal is to solve one of the
[Atari games](https://ale.farama.org/environments/). Currently, you can choose
one of the following games:
- [Breakout](https://ale.farama.org/environments/breakout/), where you must surpass the
  average return of 200;
- [Pong](https://ale.farama.org/environments/pong/), where you must surpass the
  average return of 16;

If you would like to train an agent for a different Atari game, write us on
Piazza, and we will decide the required score and add it to the list.

The template [atari_gamer.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl139/tree/master/labs/06/atari_gamer.py)
shows how to create the Atari environment. While you can use any algorithm from
the lecture to solve the environment, any one of the distributed RL DQN-like
algorithms is a reasonable choice.
