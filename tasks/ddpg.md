Solve the continuous [Pendulum-v1](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/pendulum/)
and [InvertedDoublePendulum-v5](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/inverted_double_pendulum/)
environments using the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm.

Your goal is to reach an average return of -200 for `Pendulum-v1` and 9000 for `InvertedDoublePendulum-v5`
during 100 evaluation episodes.

Start with the [ddpg.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl139/tree/master/labs/08/ddpg.py)
template, which provides a simple network implementation in PyTorch.

During evaluation in ReCodEx, two different random seeds will be employed for
both environments, and you need to reach the required return on all of them.
Time limit for each test is 10 minutes, and my solution comfortably trains the
agent during ReCodEx evaluation.
